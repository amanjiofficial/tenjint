    filter events based on event parameters (event_params). If we specify
    event parameters our callback function will only be invoked when an event is
    of the given event type (event_name) and has the specified parameters. For

            granular basis. For instance, we might not be interested in all
            second level paging events, but only in execute violations. Event
            parameters allow us to filter events based on such criteria. What
